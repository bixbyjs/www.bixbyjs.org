### Introduction

Bixby.js is a toolkit for building services using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
Bixby.js provides facilities for logging, configuration, service discovery,
message queuing, security, and other common functionality that is needed when
building cloud-based applications.  Bixby.js lets developers spend more time
building applications, and less time building infrastructure.



Users expect modern applications to be accessible from anywhere, be it an office
desktop, a tablet at home, a phone when on-the-go, or a web browser at a public
terminal.  Meeting these expectations is no easy task.  Engineering teams need
people with a wide variety of expertise: building reactive websites for a wide
range of devices, developing native clients for different operating systems,
implementing scalable back-end services, documenting APIs for use by third-party
developers, and ensuring that sensitive data is properly secured.  All of this,
and more, must be done while deplying on a regular basis and collaborating as a
team whose members change over time.

Bixby.js provides a solution that helps meet these challenges when building
back-end services.  The approach is based on clearly defined interfaces between
the components of an application and use of inter-process communication for
scalability.

As a result of this approach, Bixby.js provides two things.  First, Bixby.js
provides a suite of components that are usable in Node.js applications.  Second,
it provides specifications for any protocols used to communicate between
processes.  The latter allows applications making use of Bixby.js to integrate
with those written in other languages or frameworks and vice versa.

Bixby.js favors practical, no-nonsense development practices.  The industry at
large is awash with buzzwords and fads that come and go.  Bixby.js avoids
being mired down in such discussion and focuses on what works.  Bixby.js adopts
time-tested patterns and techniques that have proven useful in a variety of
scenarios.  Well-reasoned analysis of when - and when _not_ - to use these
techniques allows teams to make informed decisions.

The result is a coherent approach that makes it easier to develop, maintain, and
operate applications, whether you are part of a small team or a large
organization.
