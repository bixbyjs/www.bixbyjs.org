### Human-oriented Approach

One of the lessons that is hard-learned during an engineering career is that
there are no technical problems, only people problems.  This lesson is central
to what Bixby.js terms a human-oriented approach to development.

Over the lifetime of an application, a majority of the cost will be in
maintenance and support, not initial development.  However, bad decisions during
initial development can vastly increase this cost as technical debt accumulates
and routine maintenance becomes increasingly more difficult.  This problem is
exacerbated by the fact that many of the engineers involved in the beginning
stages of an application are unlikely to be involved in later stages.  Over
time, the stability of an application decreases as the shared knowledge of the
team deteriorates.

A human-oriented approach aims to alleviate this problem by, first and foremost,
facilitating a shared understanding among all people involved in the development
of an application, even across time.

Bixby.js provides this by adopting time-tested patterns and techniques and
supplying "just enough" structure to be understandable by developers of all
experience levels while not limiting flexibility.
